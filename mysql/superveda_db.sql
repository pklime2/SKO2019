 ('26','5','Metropolis (Restored Authorized Edition)','Fritz Lang`s Metropolis belongs to legend as much as to cinema. It`s a milestone of sci-fi and German expressionism. Yet the story makes minimal sense, and the &quot,theme&quot, belongs in a fortune cookie, to experience the film`s pagan power, you have to see the movie. But for decades we couldn`t, not really--not with so many versions, all incomplete, often in public-domain prints like smudged photocopies. This Murnau Foundation restoration changes all that. Some shots, scenes, and subplots may be lost forever, but intertitles indicate how they fit into the original continuity and the characters` individual trajectories. Most crucially, the images are crisp, vibrant, and three-dimensional instead of murky and flattened. The composite sequences (the Tower of Babel, a sea of lusting eyes) have been restored to their hallucinatory ferocity. And there`s one moment when you can see a bead of sweat roll down a man`s cheek--in medium long-shot','29.95','88','metro.jpg'),
 ('27','5','Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets (Widescreen Edition)','Original Release Date: April 11, 2003\nThis is the 2nd item in The Harry Potter Feature Films Series.\nFirst sequels are the true test of an enduring movie franchise, and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets passes with flying colors. Expanding upon the lavish sets, special effects, and grand adventure of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer`s Stone, Harry`s second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry involves a darker, more malevolent tale (parents with younger children beware), beginning with the petrified bodies of several Hogwarts students and magical clues leading Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) to a 50-year-old mystery in the monster-laden Chamber of Secrets. House elves, squealing mandrakes, giant spiders, and venomous serpents populate this loyal adaptation (by Sorcerer`s Stone director Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steve Kloves), and Kenneth Branagh delightfully tops the supreme supporting cast as the vainglorious charlatan Gilderoy Lockhart (be sure to view past the credits for a visual punchline at Lockhart`s expense). At 161 minutes, the film suffers from lack of depth and uneven pacing, and John Williams` score mostly reprises established themes. The young, fast-growing cast offers ample compensation, however, as does the late Richard Harris in his final screen appearance as Professor Albus Dumbledore. Brimming with cleverness, wonderment, and big-budget splendor, Chamber honors the legacy of J.K. Rowling`s novels.','29.95','97','dvd_2.jpg'),
 ('28','5','Wild Strawberries - Criterion Collection (1959)','An elderly college professor sets out in his car to receive an honorary degree--and takes a trip instead through his own past and subconscious--in this bittersweet but ultimately tender and understanding 1957 film by Swedish master Ingmar Bergman. Casting Swedish star Victor Sj?str?m in the lead, Bergman, then at the height of his powers as an international filmmaker, uses flashbacks and bright, lyrical storytelling to capture the full arc of one man`s life: the successes that seem fleeting, the disappointments that linger in the memory, the regrets that never seem to let go. In some ways, it can be seen as a forerunner of Woody Allen`s Deconstructing Harry, except that Bergman`s sense of irony is always more profound.','39.95','98','dvd_3.jpg'),
 ('29','5','The Seventh Seal - Criterion Collection (1958)','Ingmar Bergman`s 1956 film has been parodied by everyone from Woody Allen to Bill and Ted`s Bogus Journey, but it remains one of the strangest and richest classics of world cinema. Max Von Sydow plays a knight returning from the Crusades to encounter an apocalyptic scenario inspired by the Book of Genesis. He plays chess with Death (BengtEkerot), sees a manacled witch, watches a band of flagellants go by--all of it foretelling an inevitable end to life. Unabashedly allegorical and lyrical and existing in a world unto itself, the film is enormously mesmerizing no matter what one thinks of the weighty meanings Bergman has attached to it all. The DVD release has English subtitles, audio commentary by critic Peter Cowie, theatrical trailer, and Bergman`s filmography.','39.95','98','dvd_4.jpg'),
 ('30','5','The Awful Truth (1937)','One of the top five screwball comedies of the `30s, this helped to cement a genre that waxed golden until the end of WWII. Director Leo McCarey won an Oscar for Best Director for this 1937 romantic comedy--one of the most successful films of his career. Irene Dunne and Cary Grant are a squabbling couple who separate because of supposed infidelities on both sides. They part but cannot really keep away from each other. Grant finds himself hooked up with a socialite, Dunne becomes engaged to a millionaire hick played by the hapless Ralph Bellamy (as if he ever stood a chance as the &quot,other&quot, man!). When not dating others or baiting one another in a verbal war, Grant and Dunne wage a custody battle over their pathetic pooch. Gags, double entendre, witty remarks, snide comments, and fast-paced dialogue helped this to garner six Academy Award nominations. The Awful Truth was awfully good to Dunne and Grant, as both were breaking out of much more serious molds and this secured their positions.','24.95','98','dvd_5.jpg'),

 ('37','2','The Very Best Of Cher - Cher','Given a five-decade career that`s been one long series of critical write-offs and subsequent comeback triumphs, it`s tempting to argue that the natural elements are actually earth, wind, fire, water--and Cher. Anchored by her 1998 international mega-success &quot,Believe&quot, (the song that made Cher the oldest woman to score a chart topper) and its equally club-savvy contemporary collaborations with producers Mark Taylor and Brian Rawlings, &quot,Song for the Lonely&quot, and &quot,A Different Kind of Love Song,&quot, this 21-track anthology is indeed the first to contain all her No. 1 hits, stretching back to her epochal 1965 duet with Sonny Bono on the faux-Dylan &quot,I Got You Babe.&quot, And if it shortchanges her Phil Spector-rooted origins and a true perspective on her `60s and `70s career (though kitsch classic chart toppers &quot,Dark Lady,&quot, &quot,Half-Breed,&quot, and &quot,Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves&quot, are all here) to focus on her string of `80s and `90s pop successes in service of writers like Diane Warren (&quot,If I Could Turn Back Time&quot,) and Desmond Child (&quot,Just Like Jesse James&quot,), it`s good to remember that, according to the pop soothsayers, none of them were even supposed to happen, let alone make her an icon for a whole new generation. It`s a tribute to sheer, fashion-defying willpower--and as unlikely an argument for the notion of `the singer, not the song` as one is likely to find.','18.98','96','music_2.jpg'),
 ('38','2','Hittin` the Note\nAllman Brothers Band','Very rarely is a legendary band able to come up with new, credible material. Jam band progenitors the Allman Brothers have done better than that, tapping into some of the spark that made them one of the most influential American bands of their time. The lineup has changed due to tragedy, discontent, and plain orneriness, but the band is still able to conjure up dark tales of thwarted romance, dashed ambitions, and enduring friendship and tether them to freefalling slide riffs, jazzy interludes, and soulful blues that have been staples of the band since 1969. Granted, some of the guitar solos aren`t an heroic as they were when Dickey Betts in the fold, but the ballad &quot,Desdamona&quot, is as inspired as &quot,Melissa,&quot, and Gregg Allman`s singing has never been better.','18.98','98','music_3.jpg'),
 ('39','2','So, It`s Like That - Joe Bonamassa\n','New York guitar prodigy Joe Bonamassa opened for B.B. King before he was a teen, but blues is just the springboard for the sound on this second solo outing. Bonamassa spotlights his songwriting this time, using his fluid and fiery guitar work to punctuate muscular melodies more akin to anthemic arena rock than basic blues. While Bonamassa`s debut disc, A New Day Yesterday, featured a supporting cast of Gregg Allman, Rick Derringer, and Leslie West, the follow-up keeps the focus on his power trio, with drummer Kenny Kramme and bassist Eric Czar providing most of the accompaniment (although keyboardist Cliff Magness creatively colors around the edges). Bonamassa is indeed a certifiable fretboard phenom, consistently capable of startlingly effective solos, but he`s also a strong singer, and that`s what makes the collection of songs, a dozen of the 13 cowritten by Bonamassa, successful. The title track, complete with a sizzling solo, sustains a Southern blues-rock feel, but most of the other songs, such as the power pop &quot,Unbroken,&quot, the hard-rocking &quot,Sick in Love,&quot, and the retro &quot,Never Said Goodbye,&quot, which features Bonamassa on mandolin, showcase his abilities in different stylistic settings.','14.98','98','music_4.jpg'),
 ('40','2','Silver Lining - Bonnie Raitt','The latest in a series of highly polished albums of good-natured boogie, blues, and singer-songwriter fare, Bonnie Raitt`s Silver Lining won`t disappoint the initiated. Recorded with her highly seasoned road band and coproduced (again) by the ubiquitous Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake, this is a high-quality product. The question, as always, is whether the material raises it to the level of extraordinary. Raitt picks songs shrewdly. Here, the unearthed gems are David Gray`s title song and the closing ballad, &quot,Wounded Heart,&quot, by Jude Johnson. Less successful and more, well, familiar are the songs cowritten with her bandmates. Instrumental highlights include Bonnie`s slide duel with Roy Rogers on &quot,Gnawin` It&quot, and Andy Abad`s highlife guitar chops on Oliver Mtukudzi`s &quot,Hear Me Lord.&quot, Jon Cleary`s barrelhouse keys throughout owe a debt to Billy Payne of Little Feat. One may occasionally wish the producers had been allowed more rein to pepper the arrangements with their trademark quirky instrumentation, but the record rewards repeated listens.','18.98','98','silverlining.jpg'),
 ('41','6','The Princess Bride','Based on William Goldmans novel of the same name, The Princess Bride is staged as a book read by grandfather (Peter Falk) to his ill grandson (Fred Savage). Falks character assures a romance-weary Savage that the book has much more to deliver than a simpering love story, including but not limited to fencing, fighting, torture, death, true love, giants, and pirates. Indeed, The Princess Bride offers a tongue-in-cheek fairy tale depicting stable boy-turned-pirate Westleys journey to rescue Buttercup (Robin Wright), his true love, away from the evil prince (Chris Sarandon), whom she had agreed to marry five years after learning of what she had believed to be news of Westleys death. With help from Prince Humperdincks disgruntled former employee Miracle Max (Billy Crystal), swordsman Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), and a very large man named Fezzik (Andre the Giant), the star-crossed lovers are reunited.','16.5','30','BR_princessbride.jpg'),
 ('42','6','Star Trek','Mission: Impossible III director and Alias creator J.J.

Eager to send his older sibling off in style, Robs younger brother, Jason (Mike Vogel), and his girlfriend, Lily (Jessica Lucas), organize a surprise going-away party to take place the night before Rob boards his Eastern-bound flight. As the party gets underway, Robs longtime friend and current love interest, Beth (Odette Yustman), shows up with another man as the dejected guest of honors best-pal Hud (T.J. Miller) encourages partygoer Marlena (Lizzy Caplan) to wish him an on-camera farewell despite the fact that they barely know one another. Moments after Beth storms out following a bitter skirmish with Rob, the entire New York City skyline goes dark. Power is quickly restored, prompting partygoers to turn their attention toward the news, where they learn that a freight tanker has been overturned in New York Harbor. Racing to the rooftop in hopes of getting a better look at the situation, the group is terrified to witness a massive explosion that rains debris across midtown Manhattan, causing mass chaos and unparalleled destruction. But the worst is yet to come, because it soon becomes apparent that this is not the work of a terrorist or an act of war, but a massive creature beyond human comprehension. Now, as the military moves in and the streets of New York City become a virtual war zone, Rob, Lily, Marlena, and Hud race to rescue Beth and get out of the city before the powers that be unleash the ultimate weapon of mass destruction on one of the most populated cities on the planet.','17.4','60','BR_cloverfield.jpg'),
